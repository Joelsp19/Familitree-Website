I started this project as a part of a high school English project in 2020 to develop a skill. The website below gives detailed documentation about the course of this project. 
Although not yet finished, I was able to experiment with HTML, CSS, Python Flask, and learn some web development skills. 
Visit https://sites.google.com/view/familitree/home for documentation about the project. (Please be mindful- some docs are a little out of date)
